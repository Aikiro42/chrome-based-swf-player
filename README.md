# Chrome-based SWF Player
An HTML file utilizing chrome's adobe flash player in order to bring back
the easy opening of flash files.

Due to security reasons, an update of Chrome disabled the ability to play
flash files directly on the browser. This HTML file aims to give a solution
around this inconvenience by providing an interface on which to play flash
files on.

There are many flash file players floating around the internet, but none can
be more reliable than Chrome's Adobe Flash Player. This document exploits the
usuage of the <object> and <embed> elements in order to play downloaded flash
files.
